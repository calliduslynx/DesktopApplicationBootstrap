# Application Bootstrap

This is a simple bootstrap to develop client application with
javafx and kotlin.


Current features:
- Gradle Project (without gradle-wrapper)
- JavaFX configured
- Kotlin configured
- creates EXE

## Commands

- `gradle test` -> runs all tests
- `gradle build` -> builds everything, runs tests
- `gradle run` -> starts project
- `gradle createExe` -> creates a folder (/build/launch4j), containing an executable (required Java to be installed properly)
